# GymCounter
Gym session counter built using the React Library

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to practice the essentials of the React Library. It demonstrates my ability to set-up a React project with the likes of WebPack 3, while utilizing different parts of the React library to build a dynamic UI for a Gym-Session counter. The application features 3 separate screens, the first is an overall count of the days I went to the gym, the second allows me to add a day, and the last screen displays in a table all of the days that I have been to the gym.

### Running the Application

In order to run the application, you have to utilize npm.

CD to a folder that you want to start and run the application from and run `npm install`.

This should download all of the dependencies needed, if prompted also `npm install node_modules` for the application to work properly.

After all of the installations `npm start` should take you to localhost:3000 where you can view the application.

### Technologies

React.js  
WebPack 
JSX

### Challenges

One of the primary challenges I had with this project was getting the library to work with my set-up. Alot of the beginning was figuring out how to configure the correct packages, and libraries to set-up the react with dynamic UI binding so that it would automatically refresh when something was changes in the code.

Another challenge that I faced was around breaking down the components correctly so that I could make sure the application was well fragmented for code reuse.
